To really understand what prototypes are, you have to understand what objects are and where they fit in with object oriented programming. If you want to dive into the concept a little more deeply, you can find a great write-up here: http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/ However, for our purporses, let's keep it simple. Think of prototypes as "actions/modifiers/functions/bits of code" that are specific to the type of object (thing) you are working with, and that allow you to manipulate that thing in some manner.

Let's translate this into the real world. Let's say you have a a type of boat, and in your case, your specific boat is named titanic. Now that you own your boat, maybe you want take it out for a leisurely cruise across the Atlantic Ocean. In this case, your specific type of thing (boat) is titanic, and your prototype is .cruise, in other words, titanic.cruise. Before setting out though, you might also want to check out the .countLifeboats prototype.

Many of the prototypes we will be covering initially deal with arrays, such as the .length prototype, so let's use that as a more concrete programming example. So, in other words, .length is a prototype that lets you work with an array object (the type of thing) to figure out something about that array. I.E., myArray.length will tell us how many items are stored in myArray (your specific Array type of thing). If it isn't clear yet, as you read through the documentation on prototypes, this will start to make a whole lot more sense.
