				<p>This site was set up by a small group of students enrolled in a full stack web development bootcamp. We found that while there are many sites out there that attempt to teach coding, they usually don't quite deliver. Either there are pieces missing from the overall puzzle, or things ratchet up from basic to advanced too fast, and so on. This is our attempt at addressing this need.</p>
				<p>After talking to our fellow bootcamp students, we discovered that the greatest help needed was with basic JavaScript, and jQuery. Most seemed relatively comfortable with HTML/CSS. With this in mind, our plan is to begin with JS, covering the main basics that it's important to know thoroughly, and then branch out to jQuery later, before swinging back and covering HTML/CSS later for the sake of being complete. We do also plan to add further topics as we continue to learn in class.</p>
				<p>Here you'll find three main sections that you can navigate through using the buttons on the top. Technical Docs covers documentation on various commands, functions, methods, etc., that come up most often. Videos includes tutorial videos to further enhance understanding. Then, when you're feeling confident, head over the Challenges to test out your newly learned skills.</p>
				<p>We hope you find this site useful on your path to becoming a developer, and that you'll pardon the dust as we continue to build out the site.</p>
